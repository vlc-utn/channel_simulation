%% LED from (Komine, 2004)

half_angle = 70;                % [degree] Semi angle of the LED at half power illumination (I(half_angle) = 1/2 * I(0), from the Lambertian distribution)
Pt = 72;                        % [W] Transmitted optical power from the LED.
I0 = 0.73*3600*2*pi/(1+0.6461); % [lm] Total luminic power.
